# Mind-Over-Matter: Mental health analytics platform

Mind-Over-Matter is a mental health analytics tool that utilizes a custom algorithm based on facial patterns to calculate sentiment scores, builds an expansive dashboard with dynamic charts, and ultimately provides curated recommendations and auxiliary content (scraped top mental health articles and nearby psychiatrists based on zip code). This tool parses through thousands of data numerous times per minute and leverages a cascading schema design to ensure efficient performance and backend usage. Through the translation of complex facial data, users are able to easily glean insights on their emotional stature, access trends and downloadable data, and be notified on when and how to manage their overall mental health.
